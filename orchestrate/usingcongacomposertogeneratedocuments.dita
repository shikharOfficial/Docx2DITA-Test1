  <shortdesc>When you choose Conga Composer as the selected application, the options available must be from the same object type as the definition to which you want to add a Generate Document step. Document generation occurs in background mode.</shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <context>The Source picklist allows you to choose one of the following options:</context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Template: Uses the process objectâ€™s ID as the master object record.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Solution: Uses the Custom Button URL field on the selected solution record.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Custom Button: Uses the configured button URL. Only button URLs that begin with "/apex/APXTConga4__Conga_Composer" will display as options.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>

      <p>For Solution and Custom Button options:</p>
